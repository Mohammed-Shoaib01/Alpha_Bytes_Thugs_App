# Hack-O-Mania 2024 - MediaWiki Problem Statement

## Overview

Our team was one of the winners in Hack-O-Mania, a 36-hour hackathon conducted by Google Developer Student Clubs VJIT. We competed in the 1st Problem Statement: "The MediaWiki Problem Statement," which focused on making Wikipedia more accessible, easy to use, customizable, and personalized.

## Project Goals

The primary goal of our project was to lower the barrier to entry for Wikipedia, the largest online volunteer-supported encyclopedia, by enhancing its accessibility and usability. We aimed to achieve this through the following objectives:

- **Simplified Web and App UIs:** We developed user-friendly interfaces for both web and mobile platforms by integrating Wikipedia's API into our UIs.
- **Content Summarization:** We used OpenAI's text-DaVinci-003 API to shorten Wikipedia articles, making them more digestible and comprehensive for a wide variety of audiences.
- **Text-to-Speech & Speech-to-Text:** We implemented Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text features to ensure our platform is usable for a wider audience, including those with visual impairments or other disabilities.
- **Multilingual Support:** We focused on making Wikipedia articles accessible in a wide variety of languages, with a special emphasis on Telugu. We also used Google Translate's API to translate articles that were not yet translated natively.
- **Customized Search:** We enabled wiki searches in the language of the user's choice, making information more accessible to non-English speakers.
